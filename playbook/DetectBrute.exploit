Hello! Today I will show u one tool "Bruteforce Exploit Detector" /BED/.

Introduction
BED is a plain-text protocol fuzzer which stands for Bruteforce Exploit Detector.
Bed checks software for common vulnerabilities like buffer overflows, format string bugs, integer overflows, etc. 
It automatically tests the implementation of a chosen protocol by sending different combinations of commands with problematic strings to confuse the target. 
The protocols supported by this tool are: finger, ftp, http, imap, irc, lpd, pjl, pop, smtp, socks4 and socks5.BED comes pre-installed with our Kali Linux system. 
It is too easy to use so our article will be brief. 

Let's start!

[1] BED it's not installed in Kali, so write this command in terminal:

>> sudo apt install bed

[2] After installation we can use "help" to see the help-menu of BED tool

3] In the help section we clearly can see the basic use example of BED. We need to use -s flag to scan, then we need to choose <plugin>, 
then we need to specify our target (IP address) by using -t flag, then we need to specify our port using -p flag, at last we need to set our timeout by using -o flag.

Let's see an example of this, we have an host http server on port 80 we try to find vulnerabilities on it by using BED. So we need to write this command:

>> bed -s HTTP -t HOST(or IP) -p 80 -o 10

Example:
The above command will start testing for vulnerabilities on our target (offroadportal.org)

If it got any vulnerability then it will show us by showing errors.

~ Enjoy The Movement!
