[1] A smishing attack basically means to do a phishing attack with the help of SMS. In this attacker sends an SMS to the victim with a link to a fake website or you will be tricked into downloading malware which will compromise your phone and let the hacker access your device. Smishing means “SMS+Phishing”.

How it works?

>> An Attacker will create an SMS which will consist of some social engineering text and a link.

>> The link will take you to a website and possibly download the malware into your phone or will take you to a phishing website.

>> As soon as you install the malware on your phone your phone will be compromised and the hacker can access your phone.

Examples Smishing scenario:

I send you a text message with a following content for app update.

"Your application store is out of date. Please, download the updated version from here. https://tinyurl.com/AppStoreUpdate".

We have previously uploaded the fake application to some file host and we masking him with TinyURL (or other short url).

Now any person will click the link to stop the subscription and you clicked the link and my link will take you to a website that will automatically download malware to your phone and if you install the malware your phone will be compromised.

[2] How to make this attack?
