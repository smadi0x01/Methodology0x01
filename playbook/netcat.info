- Before attempting to do the steps in the following guide, make sure to disable automatic sample submission in Windows defender so your recompiled binary won't get sent to Microsoft.

1. First, download netcat for Windows source code from this website: https://eternallybored.org/misc/netcat/

(Preferably download the 1.12 version since its the less downloaded one.)

2. Unzip the file.
3. Install gcc.

// If you're on Windows and dont have gcc installed, use this easy-to-follow guide: https://dev.to/gamegods3/how-to-install-...r-way-422j

4. Now, we don't really need to use the Makefile. We can recompile netcat using the command-line.

4.1. First, open cmd within the folder containing netcat's source code.

4.2. Then, paste the following command:

gcc getopt.c doexec.c netcat.c -s -lkernel32 -luser32 -lwsock32 -lwinmm -o ncat.exe

It will show some warnings, but that's normal. In this case, the output binary will be ncat.exe.
You can test it by typing "ncat -lvp 444" and you'll see that it works.
