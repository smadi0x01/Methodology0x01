SKIP CEH, yes it is worthless, how can passing a multiple choice exam certify you as a pen tester? lol its a gimmick.

Start with learning networking and security fundamentals, look on youtube there is heaps of content.

After that look into PhdSecurity and Thecybermentor on youtube for more great free content this is practical.

Join TryHackMe and start going through their walkthroughs, there is A LOT of content so dont get scared, just tackle it bit by bit.

Take notes on everything you learn, if you dont you will be screwed.

After you have done 50+ CTF's maybe then start looking at getting the OSCP.

If u have no idea in pentesting then start with the eJPT cert, 200$ investment to start in cybersec.

It all depends on how much time and effort you want to spend.
There are many online resources that you can use to get started, hack the box, tryhackme, and so many others.

Watch videos on how people like ippsec solve boxes, read writeups, learn the techniques and the basics and start trying it on your own.
Build your own index of techniques and tools to use. 

When you feel more comfortable to challenge yourself,I would go directly for the OSCP, it has the highest value on the market, 
You need to have the time and dedication for it though.

Don't tread lightly and really focus on getting the labs done before going for the exam. All in all, grit is everything.

~ Enjoy The Movement!
