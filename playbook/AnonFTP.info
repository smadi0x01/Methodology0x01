 // How to find FTP with anonymous login and how to check some FTP for "Anonymous Login Allowed".

[1] For finding open FTP we can use Shodan Search Engine with this dork

"230 login successful" port:"21"
We choose some FTP and try to login. After successful login write "ls" to see files and dirs.

[2] For check some FTP we need to use NMAP

When attacking or targeting a system, one of the initial steps that an attacker takes is to perform a scan of the target.
This scan gives the attacker information such as open ports and running services. We used Nmap to scan the ubuntu machine that we just configured.
We can see that the Nmap was able to identify that the FTP service was functional on the target machine
and it also takes another step into enumeration and informs the attacker that the FTP service has Anonymous Login Enabled.

Command: nmap -A IP

And now we see line: ftp-anon: Anonymous FTP login Allowed (FTP code 230)
Now try to login with username: anonymous | pass: anonymous

And done!

~ Enjoy The Movement!
