This is little tutorial for NetCat. Two useful lessons.

Lesson [1] How to make local chat server? This is useful for people who they have several PCs and this is simple method for transfer links (for example).

[1] We use Kali Linux and NC is already installed here.

Open terminal and write ifconfig

[2] Copy your wlan0 IP (inet XX.XX.XX.XX)

[3] Run this command: nc -nvlp 1234

[4] In other device run this command: nc 192.168.0.103 1234

And in terminal from NetCat listening machine you will see this connection and then write your message and press Enter!
And in device number 2 you will get it

Lesson [2]: How to see if certain ports in domain are open?
Just use this command: nc -zv domainname.com port1 port2 port3 and etc, press Enter.

If the ping succeeds, the output shows the successful connection message. The -z option ensures the connection does not persist.

~ Enjoy The Movement!
