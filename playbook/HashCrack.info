Hello! In this tutorial I will show u how to crack password hash with JohnTheRipper

[1] Open a text document by typing gedit 

[2] Paste your hash and press SAVE

[3] Save document in root dir "pass.txt" (in my screenshot the name is breach_tut.txt

[4] Open terminal and write the command:
>> john pass.txt

Press Enter and wait.

When John is done, you will see the result. In this example Im not waited for the result.

For using your wordlist, u can try this command
>> john –wordlist=your_wordlst.txt –rules pass.txt

For Hashcat: sudo gzip -d /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt.gz

~ Enjoy The Movement!
