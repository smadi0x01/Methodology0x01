[1] Location: /usr/share/wordlists

[2] Dirb Wordlists --> [b]Location: /usr/share/wordlists/dirb

[/b] To take a closer look at one of the directories, we use the tree command to list all the wordlists inside the dirb directory. 
Here we have different wordlists that differ in size and languages. 
There is an extensions wordlist too so that the attacker can use that directory to perform a Directory Bruteforce. 
There are some application-specific wordlists such as apache.txt or sharepoint.txt as well.

[3] Rockyou Wordlist --> Location: /usr/share/wordlists

Rockyou.txt is a set of compromised passwords from the social media application developer also known as RockYou.
It developed widgets for the Myspace application.
In December 2009, the company experienced a data breach resulting in the exposure of more than 32 million user accounts.
It was mainly because of the companyâ€™s policy of storing the passwords in cleartext.

When first booting Kali Linux, it will be compressed in a gz file. 
To unzip run the following command. It will decompress and ready for use on any kind of attack you want:
>> gzip -d /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt.gz

[4] Wfuzz Wordlists --> Location: /usr/share/wordlists/wfuzz
Wfuzz tool was developed to perform Bruteforcing attacks on web applications.
It can further be used to enumerate web applications as well.
It can enumerate directories, files, and scripts, etc.
It can change the request from GET to POST as well.
That is helpful in a bunch of scenarios such as checking for SQL Injections. 
It comes with a set of predefined wordlists. 
These wordlists are designed to be used with wfuzz but they can be used anywhere you desire.
The wordlists are divided into categories such as general, Injections, stress, vulns, web services, and others.

Looking into the Injections directory we see that we have an All_attack.txt that is a pretty generic wordlist for testing injections. 
Then we have a specific one for SQL, Directory Traversal, XML, XSS injections.
Moving onto the general directory, we see that we have the big.txt that we discussed in the Dirb section.
We have common.txt that also is the default wordlist in many tools due to its small size. 
Then we have the extensions_common.txt which contains like 25-ish extensions that might be enumerated some files that can be considered low-hanging fruits.

Installing other wordlist ---> SecList
Seclists are a collection of multiple types of wordlists that can be used during Penetration Testing or Vulnerability Assessment, all collected in one place. 
These wordlists can contain usernames, passwords, URLs, sensitive data patterns, fuzzing payloads, web shells, etc. To install on Kali Linux,
we will use the apt command followed by the Seclists as shown in the image below.

>> sudo apt install seclists

The installation will create a directory by the name of Seclists inside the /usr/share location. 
Going through we can see the different categories of wordlists such as Discovery, Fuzzing, IOCs, Misc, Passwords, Pattern Matching, Payloads, Usernames, and Web-Shells.

!!! Directory: /usr/share/seclists
